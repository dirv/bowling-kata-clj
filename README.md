# bowling-kata-clj
Bowling kata in Clojure. Tests are written with [Speclj](http://www.speclj.com).

To run, you'll need to install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). You can then run tests using the command line like this:

    lein deps # installs Speclj
    lein spec

You can also use `lein spec -a` to have Speclj run your tests each time you make filesystem changes.
